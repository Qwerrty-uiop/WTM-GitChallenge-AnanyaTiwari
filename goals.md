## My Short-Term Goals (Next 6 Months)
1. **Solidify Fundamentals:** I want to build a strong foundation in C++ and Java to improve my logic building and problem-solving skills.
2. **Version Control:** I aim to become proficient in Git and GitHub to collaborate effectively on team projects and open-source contributions.
3. **Community Engagement:** I plan to attend weekly workshops and mentor at least one junior student to help them get started with their tech journey.
